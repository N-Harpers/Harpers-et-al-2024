# Harpers-et-al-2024
Repository containing data of the study:' Effects of chemical alteration on frictional properties in a deep, granitic, geothermal system in Cornwall: Direct shear experiments at near in-situ conditions' by Harpers et al. 2024.
Raw data can be read in with the 'Reading_data_Liverpool.m' script into Matlab. For the study, this data was then analysed using RSFit3000 after Skabek and Savage (2019), a MatLab program to determine rate-and-state friction parameters from friction over displacement.
